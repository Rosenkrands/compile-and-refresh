# Documentation for the Compile and Refresh script
The car.ps1 script is a quick and easy way to compile and preview TeX documents in PDF format.
The script will assume that notepad++ and firefox are your TeX editor and PDF viewer respectively.
Furthermore the script assumes that it is placed in the same folder as a TeX file.
