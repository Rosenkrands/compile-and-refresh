# Documentation for the Compile and Refresh script

I no longer use this script as i switched my LaTeX editor to VSCode (LaTeX Workshop).

The car.ps1 script is a quick and easy way to compile and preview TeX documents in PDF format.
The script will assume that notepad++ and firefox are your TeX editor and PDF viewer respectively.
Furthermore the script assumes that it is placed in the same folder as a TeX file.
